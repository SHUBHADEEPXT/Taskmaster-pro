# CI/CD Documentation - TaskMaster Pro

This folder is dedicated to documenting all aspects of the CI/CD process for the TaskMaster Pro project.

## What to Document Here

- **Jenkins Pipeline Scripts:**
  - Store example Jenkinsfiles, pipeline snippets, and explanations of each stage.
- **CI/CD Design Decisions:**
  - Rationale for tool choices (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
  - Pipeline structure and quality gates (lint, test, build, deploy)
- **Troubleshooting Notes:**
  - Common errors and their solutions (e.g., PEP 668, Docker agent issues)
  - Lessons learned from pipeline failures and fixes
- **Links to Related Docs:**
  - Reference to main project README, daily logs in `docs/`, and screenshots
- **Future Enhancements:**
  - Plans for adding Docker build/push, deployment automation, ArgoCD, SonarQube, etc.
  - Comparisons between different CI/CD tools as you experiment

## Current Status
- Jenkins-based CI pipeline is set up for backend linting (flake8)
- All linting errors have been fixed and the pipeline is green
- Next steps: add backend tests, Docker builds, and deployment stages

## Suggestions for This Folder
- Add a `troubleshooting.md` for common CI/CD issues
- Add a `pipelines/` subfolder for different pipeline scripts (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, etc.)
- Document environment setup for Jenkins agents and runners
- Keep this folder updated as you iterate on your CI/CD process
